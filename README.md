# db-side-project
Independent side project to create a database that can be easily managed with an easy to use input form with specified inputs that branch off of each other accordingly.
</br>
Will build using Python3, SQlite3, and probably Django for modeling the inputs, as that is probably the simplest way to also have an easy admin control that was requested as well.
